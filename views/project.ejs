    <p>Project Description:
As a quality assurance engineer at PepsiCo, I optimized the Bag in Box line (BIB) flavor
changeover process. The Bag in Box line produces selected PepsiCo beverages in plastic bags
containing 12L or 20L of syrup. The boxes containing these individual plastic packages are
shipped to stores or fast food restaurants that dilute it with water and put into their drink
dispensers. As it is diluted with water once it reaches a store dispenser, these individual product
bags can last over its 20L or 12L syrup limit. At BIB, the changeover process from one specific
flavor to the next requires very careful attention as well as the use of various tanks and valves.
The process of going from a diet product to a non-diet product as well as cleaning
out tank all has different implementation steps.
</p>
<p>Syrup is transported from the plant’s syrup room to the Bag in Box line’s flow tank via pipes.
The syrup room is where ingredients are mixed and generated by operators through the use of 19
tanks. After doing so, the pipes that are connected from each line to the syrup room’s source tank
is called in to start the production line. However, during the changeover process for the Bag in
Box line, I analyzed that at about 300L of syrup is lost in the transition process from one run to
the other, which accounts to about $1000 per week. The reason for this is because once the BIB
tank reaches 600L, the line operator calls for syrup, however currently the line operator uses
carbon dioxide to remove the syrup that gets stuck in pipes instead of water. This makes the
syrup that flows in unusable.
</p>
<p>I communicated with contractors and line operators to learn the process of using H20 to remove the excess syrup instead of CO2. I also used SolidWorks to construct an easy-to-read diagram displaying how the syrup travels from the syrup room and rests above the water that is already in the tank due to the different densities. After a month of overseeing and monitoring frontline leaders on a daily basis, all the line operators was able to master the concept. Hence, the BIB line stopped losing syrup at the Bag in Box due to poor flavour transition processes and thus saving $1000 per run.</p>
